# Trie

+ Trie implementation which uses nodes storing a single character and a flag indicating if they are a completed word
+ Tries offer efficient textual lookups by prefix
+ This implementation uses a fixed-size vector and assumes lowercase characters.
+ For larger character sets, this should be updated to use an associative container to keep unused memory to a minimum
